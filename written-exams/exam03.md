## Exam

> Take a look at the attached mockups, and assume you're being assigned to build them - but, for some reason, have been given very little information. These are screenshots of a feature that a Havenly designer uses to show a room concept, and its products, to a user.

> Answer the following questions:

* What are the most important questions you have about the mocks and how they should work?
* What seems like, potentially, the biggest unknown?
* What changes would you recommend making to make this interface work well on mobile?
