## Challenge

Please answer each question to the best of your ability, and discuss your answer. Either write your answers below the original questions or attach them in a separate document (format is up to you).

Build the following page design. Make the layout respond as shown at the `600px` and `320px` widths. The design should be fluid up to a max-width of `1200px`. Don't worry about copying the text. Just use placeholders.
