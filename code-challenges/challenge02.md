<strong>How many swaps does i take to organize books</strong>

* Jane has a shelf of `n` books, and for our purposes, they each have an `id` that is represented as an `integer`, and will be unique. 

* Given an array of thes `id's`, please complete the function below to `return` an `integer` telling the user how many swaps it will take to `"organize"` the books from `lowest id` to `highest id`. 

* Assume Jane can only swap books that are touching, i.e. with a distance of `(+/-) 1 unit`

## Data

```javascript
const list = [1,3,10,2,5,7,9,4,6,8];

console.log( getSwapCount(list) );
```
